This is a simple API for adding and management of appointments.

GET /appointments.json -> returns appointments in JSON format
	Optional parameters : 	st => start filter
							et => ending filter

POST /appointments.json	-> Creatd a new appointment record
	parameters : {appointment: { [properties list] } }


PUT /appointments/id.json -> Updates the specified record
	parameters : {appointment: { [properties list] } }

DELETE /appointments/id.json -> Deletes the specified record

the project contains a file at /testing_service.html which maked a series of JS calls to the server to exercise the endpoints described.
The project includes test cases written with MiniTest to test the update/create validation on the appointments class.

Any other questions about this implementation please do not hesitate to ask.
